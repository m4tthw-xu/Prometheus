# Prometheus
This is a game made by Jonathan Lin, Hao Zheng, and Matthew Xu from James E. Taylor High School. This is our submission for the FBLA Computer Game & Simulation Programming event for 2021-2022.

# How to run
Download "`Prometheus.exe`" and "`Prometheus.pck`". Ensure that both of these files are in the same folder. Then, double click on the executable file to run the game. Although judges will have access to the source code, it is not needed. Everything needed for the game is exported into the .exe and supporting .pck file.

Depending on the platform you downloaded our game from, the files may be zipped together. To unzip the files simply right click the zipped folder, then click "unzip" or "extract all"

# Theme
This game is based off the Greek myth of Prometheus - the one who stole climbed Mt. Olympus to steal fire from the gods and give to humans.

# Objective

The objective of our game is to climb upward for each level and reach the portals at the top, simulating Prometheus climbing Mt. Olympus. To achieve the highest score, kill the highest number of enemies in the least amount of time. A greater amount of time taken to complete the game will result in a lower final score.

# Disclaimer

ALL levels ARE doable, though each level increases in difficulty.

# Documentation
There are comments to increase code readibility. Our game structure is divided into "scenes" and "scripts." Scene files end in in the ".tscn" file extension while scripts end in the ".gd" file extension. Scenes help us visualize the changes we make to the game, while scripts help to control the background logic that controls the players, physics, calculations, etc. Most of our game's background logic is contained inside the file "player.gd"

# Copyright & Licensing

Most art, music, code in our game were created in house by us. The Godot licensing agreement allows game developers FULL control over games developed with the Godot game engine. In other words, we have full copyright and licensing rights.
